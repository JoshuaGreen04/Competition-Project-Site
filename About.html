        <h2>About us</h2>
        <p>Our goal is to honor the ancient Library of Alexandria (as that's where our name comes from). We want to help enlighten the world. <br><br>
            We know what many other online bookstores (or what was once just a book store) are like. They can be horrible and searching for the most profit at every opportunity, we don't do that. We try to keep our prices low, but still be able to pay our employees and keep this website running. <br><br>
            Of course, not all bookstores are like...the massive brands we all know, but too any are. If you know one with better intentions at heart than that, we happily encourage you to use their services. <br><br>
            We simply would love to do good and keep every enlightened to the world, that's why our symbol is the Lighthouse of Alexandria, and not the library. We know what can happen to knowledge, and the library suffered that fate long ago, but the lighthouse still stands and enlightens the world in its own way. <br><br>
            (Plus we offer more than just books here too!)
